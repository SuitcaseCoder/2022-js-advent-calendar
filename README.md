# 2022 Coding Advent Calendar


Welcome to the 2022 Coding Algorithm Advent Calendar. During the winter break, it's easy to forget about your computer's existence. And we all know how easy it is to forget about code during this time. Don't worry, I gotcha!

## What you'll practice: 
- recursion
- string manipulation
- array manipulation
- loops
- functions and/or methods


## Ideas:
- pick your poison: javaScript, Java, or both!
- practice pseudo-coding
- practice talking as you code (yes, out loud even if it feels awkward)
- 



## Day 1: Max Characters
___
### Topics covered: 
- Arrays
- Dictionaries


 ### Given a string of characters, return the character that appears the most often.


 > INPUT: `"winter wonderland"`
>
 > EXPECTED OUTPUT: `n` -> because the letter 'n' appears 3 times, which is more than any other letter in "winter wonderland";




## Day 2: Array Chunking
___ 
### Topics covered:
- Arrays
- Loops
- Array Methods


### Given an array and a size, split the array items into a list of arrays of the given size.

###### Examples:
> INPUT: array: `[2,6,4,6,9,0,1]` size: `3` 
> 
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `[[2,6,4], [6,9,0], [1]]`

> INPUT: array: `[2,6,4,6,9,0,17,2,6,9,4,4,2,7,6]` size: `5`
> 
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `[[2,6,4,6,9], [0,17,2,6,9], [4,4,2,7,6]]`
