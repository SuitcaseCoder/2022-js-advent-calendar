# 2022 Coding Advent Calendar


Welcome to the 2022 Coding Algorithm Advent Calendar. During the winter break, it's easy to forget about your computer's existence. And we all know how easy it is to forget about code during this time. Don't worry, I gotcha!

## What you'll practice: 
- recursion
- string manipulation
- array manipulation
- loops
- functions and/or methods


## Ideas:
- pick your poison: javaScript, Java, or both!
- practice pseudo-coding
- practice talking as you code (yes, out loud even if it feels awkward)
- 



## Day 1: Max Characters
___
### Topics covered: 
- Arrays
- Dictionaries


 ### Given a string of characters, return the character that appears the most often.


 > INPUT: `"winter wonderland"`
>
 > EXPECTED OUTPUT: `n` -> because the letter 'n' appears 3 times, which is more than any other letter in "winter wonderland";




## Day 2: Array Chunking
___ 
### Topics covered:
- Arrays
- Loops
- Array Methods


### Given an array and a size, split the array items into a list of arrays of the given size.

###### Examples:
> INPUT: array: `[2,6,4,6,9,0,1]` size: `3` 
> 
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `[[2,6,4], [6,9,0], [1]]`

> INPUT: array: `[2,6,4,6,9,0,17,2,6,9,4,4,2,7,6]` size: `5`
> 
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `[[2,6,4,6,9], [0,17,2,6,9], [4,4,2,7,6]]`





## Day 3: isPalindrome
___

### Topics covered*:
\* your path in solving this may not cover all of the below, or you may use other tools not listed
- strings
- string manipulation
- arrays
- loops
- regex 


### Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome, otherwise return false. (Hint: Palindrome: a word that is the spelled the exact same in either direction.)

###### Examples:
> INPUT: string: `reindeer`
>
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `false` -> because reindeer and reednier (reindeer backwards) is not the same

> INPUT: strinig: `kayak`
>
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `true` -> because kayak is the same as kayak spelled backwards

## Day 4: Reverse a String
___ 

### Topics covered:
- Arrays
- Loops
- Array Methods


### Given a string of words, find the words that are longer than 3 characters long, and return an array of those words reversed. 

###### Examples:
> INPUT: string: `life is like a box of chocolates.`
>
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `['efil', 'ekil','setalocohc']` -> `life`, `like`, and `chocolates` are all longer than 3 characters.

> INPUT: string: `fuller go easy on the pepsi`
>
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `['relluf', 'ysae', 'ispep']` -> `relluf` is `fuller` reversed

> INPUT: string `Has this toothbrush been approved by the American Dental Association?`
> 
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `['siht', 'hsurbhtoot', 'neeb','devorppa', 'nacirema', 'latned', 'noitaicossa']`


## Day 5: Fizz Buzz
___ 

### Topics covered:
- Arrays
- Loops
- Array Methods


### Print numbers from 1 to 100, but, multiple of three should print “Fizz” and similarly print “Buzz” for multiples of 5 and lastly print “FizzBuzz” for multiples of three and five.


###### Examples:

> EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
> 
>
> 1
</br>
> 2
</br>
> 'fizz'
</br>
> 4
</br>
> 'buzz'
</br>
> 'fizz'
</br>
> 7
> </br>
> 8
> </br>
> 'fizz'
> </br>
> 10
> </br>
> 11
> </br>
> 'fizz'
> </br>
> 13
> </br>
> 14
> </br>
> 'fizzbuzz'
></br> 
>...
> 

`

> INPUT: array: `[2,6,4,6,9,0,17,2,6,9,4,4,2,7,6]` size: `5`
>
> EXPECTED OUTPUT: `[[2,6,4,6,9], [0,17,2,6,9], [4,4,2,7,6]]`
